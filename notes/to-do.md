# A list of things I haven't done yet

## Miscellaneous

Image Resizing and optimizing for uploaded images via:
https://github.com/JimBobSquarePants/ImageProcessor


## example project stuff

gulp/grunt work for production ie fontawesome copy to folder

latest trend single page site but the blog would be a separate page

### an example that uses a single page for home about contact with scrolling and paralax - try it also for joeaudette.com
for that I think I would just use a single Home Index view and have the content right in the view
code the anchors into the navigation
then still be able to add cms pages in the nav dynamically but the cms would not be the default route in this case
since the home index would be
therefore I will use an url like /p/page-name
